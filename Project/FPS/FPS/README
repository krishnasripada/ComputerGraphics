Description:

In the current version of the code, we can strafe left, right, move front and bad. Also few 3D models are placed in the scene is make it realistic. A skycube is added to make the scene appealing and then lighting and texture is taken care. Mouse movements are also added which allows 360 degree movement.

Things to work on:

I would like to apply collision detection to make the experience of walking around more realistic. Also I would like to add few targets so that the gun can fire at them. If imd permits, I will add shadows to the seen.
